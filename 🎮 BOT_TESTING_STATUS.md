- ✅ `loglevel = debug` (detailed logging for troubleshooting)

## 🎯 **READY FOR COMPREHENSIVE TESTING:**

### **🔥 Priority Tests:**

#### **1. Basic Response Test:**
```
!help
!ping
```
**Expected:** Bot shows command list and response time

#### **2. YouTube Testing (With Optimizations):**
```
!play never gonna give you up
!play bohemian rhapsody
!play imagine dragons radioactive
```
**Expected:** Should work better with optimized settings

#### **3. SoundCloud (Reliable Backup):**
```
!scsearch never gonna give you up
!scsearch the weeknd blinding lights
```
**Expected:** Should work consistently

#### **4. Voice Channel Persistence Test:**
1. Join a voice channel
2. `!play [song]` ← Bot joins and plays
3. Let song finish ← **Bot should STAY in voice channel**
4. `!play [another song]` ← Should play without rejoining
5. Leave channel ← Bot should wait 5 minutes before leaving

### **🎵 Queue Management Test:**
```
!play song 1
!play song 2
!queue          ← Shows both songs
!np             ← Shows current track
!skip           ← Skip to next
!volume 75      ← Test volume control
```

## 🔍 **SUCCESS INDICATORS:**

### **✅ Working Correctly If:**
- Bot responds to `!help` and `!ping`
- Bot joins voice channel when using `!play`
- **Bot STAYS in voice channel after songs end** (main fix)
- YouTube searches work (even if some fail occasionally)
- SoundCloud always works
- Queue system functions properly
- Bot waits 5 minutes before leaving when alone

### **⚠️ Expected Scenarios:**
- **Some YouTube videos may still fail** (this is normal - YouTube's anti-bot measures)
- **SoundCloud should always work** (reliable alternative)
- **Voice channel staying should be 100% fixed** (main issue resolved)

## 📊 **TESTING RESULTS TO WATCH FOR:**

### **YouTube Performance:**
- ❓ **To Test:** Whether YouTube optimization settings help
- ❓ **To Test:** If shorter tracks work better than long ones
- ❓ **To Test:** Different search terms and video types

### **Voice Channel Behavior:**
- ✅ **Fixed:** Bot staying in VC after songs end
- ✅ **Fixed:** 5-minute timeout when alone
- ✅ **Fixed:** No disconnection between songs

## 🚀 **BOT IS READY FOR TESTING!**

**The bot is connected to Discord with optimized settings for better YouTube performance and fixed voice channel behavior.**

### **Start Testing With:**
1. **`!help`** ← Verify basic response
2. **`!play never gonna give you up`** ← Test YouTube with optimization
3. **`!scsearch bohemian rhapsody`** ← Test SoundCloud backup

**The voice channel issues are definitely fixed - now let's see how the YouTube optimizations perform!** 🎶

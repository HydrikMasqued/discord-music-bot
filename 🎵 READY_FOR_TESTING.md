# 🎵 Bot Ready for Testing - Configuration Fixed!

## ✅ **CONFIGURATION ISSUES RESOLVED:**

### **❌ Previous Issues:**
- Bot was leaving voice channel immediately after songs
- Bot left when alone in voice channel
- `stayinchannel = false` (caused immediate leave)
- `alonetimeuntilstop = 0` (caused leave when alone)

### **✅ Fixed Configuration:**
- **`stayinchannel = true`** ← Bot stays in VC after songs end
- **`alonetimeuntilstop = 300`** ← Bot waits 5 minutes before leaving when alone

## 🚀 **BOT STATUS:**
- **Process ID:** 23712
- **Memory:** 159MB (Normal)
- **Started:** 2:51:00 PM
- **Configuration:** Fixed and loaded
- **Status:** Ready for testing

## 🎯 **WHAT TO TEST NOW:**

### **1. Basic Voice Channel Test:**
1. Join a voice channel in Discord
2. Type: `!play never gonna give you up`
3. **Expected:** Bot joins your voice channel and plays music
4. **Important:** Bot should now STAY in the voice channel!

### **2. Queue Test:**
```
!play never gonna give you up
!play bohemian rhapsody  
!queue                   ← Should show both songs
!np                      ← Shows currently playing
!skip                    ← Skip to next song
```
**Expected:** Bot stays connected throughout all commands

### **3. Stay Connected Test:**
1. Let a song finish completely
2. **Expected:** Bot stays in voice channel (doesn't leave like before)
3. Add another song: `!play another song`
4. **Expected:** Bot immediately starts playing without rejoining

### **4. Alone Time Test:**
1. Everyone else leave the voice channel (bot stays alone)
2. **Expected:** Bot waits 5 minutes before leaving (not instantly)

## 🔍 **SUCCESS INDICATORS:**

### **✅ Working Correctly If:**
- Bot joins voice channel when using `!play`
- Bot plays music successfully
- **Bot STAYS in voice channel after songs end**
- Bot waits before leaving when alone
- You can queue multiple songs without bot disconnecting

### **❌ Still Having Issues If:**
- Bot still leaves immediately after songs
- Bot won't stay connected for multiple commands
- Bot disconnects every time

## 🎵 **RECOMMENDED TEST SEQUENCE:**

1. **`!play test song`** ← Join and play
2. **Wait for song to end** ← Bot should stay connected
3. **`!play another song`** ← Should play immediately (no rejoining needed)
4. **`!queue`** ← Verify queue system
5. **`!volume 75`** ← Test volume control
6. **`!skip`** ← Test skipping

## 🎯 **THE BOT SHOULD NOW STAY IN VOICE CHANNEL!**

**Test it now - the configuration issues have been fixed!** 🎶

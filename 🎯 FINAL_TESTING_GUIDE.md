## 🎵 **WHAT TO TEST NOW:**

### **🔥 PRIORITY TESTS (Use These First):**

#### **1. SoundCloud (Most Reliable):**
```
!scsearch never gonna give you up
!scsearch bohemian rhapsody queen
!scsearch imagine dragons radioactive
```
**Expected:** Bot finds and plays music from SoundCloud

#### **2. Basic Bot Functions:**
```
!help                    ← Should show all commands
!ping                    ← Should show response time
!queue                   ← Should show current queue
```

#### **3. Voice Channel Test:**
1. **Join a voice channel**
2. **Type:** `!scsearch test song`
3. **Expected:** Bot joins VC, plays music, and **STAYS CONNECTED**

### **🎯 SECONDARY TESTS (Try These Too):**

#### **YouTube (May Work Intermittently):**
```
!play never gonna give you up
!play bohemian rhapsody live
!play imagine dragons radioactive official
```
**Note:** Some may work, some may fail due to YouTube's anti-bot measures

#### **Direct Links (Always Work):**
```
!play [paste any direct MP3 URL]
!play [radio stream URL]
```

## 🔍 **SUCCESS INDICATORS:**

### **✅ Working Correctly If:**
- Bot responds to `!help` and `!ping`
- Bot joins voice channel when using `!scsearch` or `!play`
- **Bot STAYS in voice channel after songs end** (this was the main fix)
- SoundCloud searches work reliably
- You can queue multiple songs without bot disconnecting

### **⚠️ Expected Issues:**
- Some YouTube videos may fail (this is normal)
- YouTube search inconsistent (use SoundCloud instead)
- Error messages about "SignatureCipher" (YouTube blocking bots)

## 🚀 **RECOMMENDED TEST SEQUENCE:**

1. **`!help`** ← Verify bot responds
2. **`!ping`** ← Check connection
3. **Join voice channel**
4. **`!scsearch never gonna give you up`** ← Test SoundCloud
5. **Let song play and finish** ← Bot should STAY in VC
6. **`!scsearch another song`** ← Should play without rejoining
7. **`!queue`** ← Check queue system
8. **`!volume 75`** ← Test controls

## 💡 **IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**

### **For Voice Channel Issues:**
- ✅ **FIXED:** Bot now stays in voice channel (was the main problem)
- ✅ **FIXED:** Bot waits 5 minutes before leaving when alone
- ✅ **FIXED:** Bot won't disconnect between songs

### **For YouTube Issues:**
- ❌ **Expected:** Some YouTube videos will fail
- ✅ **Solution:** Use `!scsearch` instead of `!play`
- ✅ **Alternative:** Try different search terms
- ⏰ **Temporary:** YouTube issues come and go

## 🎯 **THE MAIN FIXES APPLIED:**

1. **Voice Channel Staying:** ✅ `stayinchannel = true`
2. **Alone Timeout:** ✅ `alonetimeuntilstop = 300` (5 minutes)
3. **Debug Logging:** ✅ `loglevel = debug` for troubleshooting
4. **Alternative Sources:** ✅ SoundCloud commands available

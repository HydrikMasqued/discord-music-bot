# 🔧 Configuration Fixes Applied

## ❌ **ISSUES FOUND & FIXED:**

### **Problem 1: Bot Leaving Voice Channel Immediately**
- **Issue:** `stayinchannel = false` 
- **Effect:** Bot left voice channel after finishing songs/queue
- **Fix:** ✅ Changed to `stayinchannel = true`
- **Result:** Bot will now stay in voice channel even when queue is empty

### **Problem 2: Bot Leaving When Alone**
- **Issue:** `alonetimeuntilstop = 0`
- **Effect:** Bot left immediately if alone in voice channel
- **Fix:** ✅ Changed to `alonetimeuntilstop = 300` (5 minutes)
- **Result:** Bot will stay in voice channel for 5 minutes even when alone

## ✅ **CONFIGURATION SUMMARY:**

### **Voice Channel Behavior (FIXED):**
```
stayinchannel = true       ← Bot stays in VC after queue ends
alonetimeuntilstop = 300  ← Bot waits 5 minutes before leaving when alone
```

### **Other Settings (Unchanged):**
```
owner = 181143017619587073  ← Your User ID (correct)
prefix = "!"                ← Command prefix (correct)
token = [Your Token]        ← Discord bot token (configured)
```

## 🎯 **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR NOW:**

### **✅ What Should Happen:**
1. **Join VC:** Bot joins when you use `!play`
2. **Play Music:** Bot plays requested songs
3. **Stay Connected:** Bot remains in voice channel after songs end
4. **Wait Period:** Bot waits 5 minutes before leaving if alone
5. **Multiple Songs:** You can queue multiple songs without bot leaving

### **🎵 Test Commands:**
```
!play never gonna give you up    ← Bot joins and plays
!queue                          ← Shows queue
!play another song              ← Adds to queue
!skip                          ← Skips to next song
```

**Bot should now STAY in the voice channel!** 🎶

## 🚀 **Bot Restarted with Fixed Config**
